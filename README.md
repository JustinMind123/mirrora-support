# Mirrora AI – Privacy Policy

_Last updated: February 1, 2026_

This Privacy Policy explains how Mirrora AI (“Mirrora”, “we”, “us”) handles information when you use the app.

---

## 1. Information You Provide

- Your name (used for personalization within the app)
- Your date of birth (used to verify minimum age requirement)
- Messages you send during conversations

---

## 2. How Information Is Used

- To personalize your in-app experience
- To verify that you meet the 18+ age requirement
- To generate AI responses
- To improve app stability and functionality

---

## 3. AI Processing & Backend Services

When you send messages in Mirrora, your message content is transmitted to a secure backend service operated by the developer. This backend communicates with a third-party AI provider to generate responses.

The developer does not maintain a database of user conversations. Messages are processed for the purpose of generating responses and are not stored by the developer after processing.

Third-party AI providers process data according to their own privacy policies.

## 4. Data Storage

Chat history and personalization settings are stored locally on your device. If you delete the app, locally stored data is removed from your device.

---

## 5. Subscriptions & Payments

Subscription purchases are processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information. All billing and refunds are handled by Apple in accordance with their policies.

---

## 6. Advertising

Mirrora may display advertisements through third-party advertising networks such as Google AdMob. These services may collect certain device information (such as device identifiers or usage data) in accordance with their own privacy policies.

You may manage advertising preferences through your device settings.

---

## 7. International Data Transfers

Because Mirrora uses third-party infrastructure and AI services, data may be processed in countries outside of your place of residence. By using the app, you acknowledge that your information may be transferred internationally for processing.

---

## 8. Children’s Privacy

Mirrora is intended only for individuals aged 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 18.

---

## 9. Data Deletion

You may delete locally stored data by removing the app from your device.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated in future versions of the app. Continued use of the app after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
